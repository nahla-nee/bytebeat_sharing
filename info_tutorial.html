      Bytebeats and floatbeats are a form of low-complexity art where in music is generated through
      algorithmic manipulation of a continously incrementing variable, though there are many
      definitions and restrictions that vary from person to person. This type of art draws inspiration
      from the demoscene and is focused on making art out of very minimal resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though traditionally made via C programs, bytebeat music has can be replicated anywhere, and a
      popular way of creating it as of late has been via Javascript. The basic concepts remain between
      language to language, and are easiest to demonstrate through  this simple bytebeat:
    </p>
    <pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
    int t = 0;
    for(;;t++) {
        putchar(t)
    }
}
    </pre>
    <p>
      In the above C program the variable, t, is continously incremented, and then, via the putchar
      function is "printed" to the screen. This doesn't print the textual representation of the
      numerical value that t holds, but rather prints the actual numerical value as if it was a
      a character. The traditional way to play bytebeats is to then run this program, and pipe its
      output into a sound device, via ALSA usually, if on Linux. The sound device can be configured
      in many different ways, but the "standard" way is to play 8 bit audio at 8kHz. In the example
      above, only the lowest byte is played, the fact that its an integer with 4 bytes doesn't do
      much in this context, but it allows right shifting the bits to create more interesting patterns
      later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are not familiar with digital audio and aren't sure what this means, essentially we are
      creating a sound wave. The sample rate here means how many times the player is "polling" our
      program for a value per second to play.

      Now that we have a base understanding of how bytebeats are made, let's delve into the different
      types of bytebeats that there are. This website only supports 3 types: unsigned bytebeats (or 
      just "bytebeats"), signed bytebeats, and floatbeats. They all function the same essentially,
      what differs is the data type that is expected in the output, and its range. They are all
      used for various reasons and at varying configurations, but the ideas from the Info section above
      hold true for all three.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are working with the editor in the main section of the website, you can simply imagine
      that your code is being magically inserted where that t variable is in the example above.
    </p>
    <h2>Signed and Unsigned Bytebeats</h2>
    <p>
      As the name would suggest, these types of bytebeats work by outputting a single byte, this byte's
      value maybe interpreted as either a signed byte (whose values range from -128 to 127), or an
      unsigned byte (whose values range from 0 to 255). This has no bearing on your code per se, but
      it changes how the player interprets the results that you give it. The general way of creating
      bytebeats is through bitwise and arithmetic operations. Explaining the patterns that each
      operator produces and how to combine them is a bit out of the scope of this brief explanation,
      but searching for a "bytebeat tutorial" should yield helpful results.
    </p>
    <h2>Floatbeats</h2>
    <p>
      Floatbeats operate similarly to bytebeats, you have an integer variable t that is constantly
      incrementing and a player reading your output at some fixed sample rate to play audio. The
      key difference here is that the player expects the data type to be a 32-bit floating point
      number, and it expects its range to be from -1 to 1. The main method of creating floatbeats is
      through arithemtic operatios, and trig functions. Floatbeats can be easier for some to reason
      about due to this. Floatbeats can also be "less" lo-fi compared to bytebeats as the actual value
      range is much greater than 255 values, giving you much finer control over the audio produced at
      the expense of more resources consumption.
